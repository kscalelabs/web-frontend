# ü§ñ KScale Web Redesign - Fall 2024

This is the repo for []()'s website redesign.

If modifying adhere files adhere to [atomic programming standards](https://www.webstacks.com/blog/atomic-design-methodology).
No need to be legalistic about it however it is a good idea to create components that have
either 1 singular purpose or 1 abstracted singular purpose.

As you will see, the code structure and files are compartmentalized
as much as possible so that it is simple to locate things.

> Clean code is always a win.

Don't let deadlines be an excuse for sloppiness, this site was made in less than 2 weeks, and we still adhered to atomic programming as much as possible.

At the end of day, don't forget to have fun and learn lots. :)

## üì∑ Update Images

Need to put in new images to the landing page?

1. Add images to the `/public/photos` folder, use a meaningful name if possible
2. In `/src/util/photoPaths.tsx`:
   1. There is `photoPaths` constant where you can update the path to your image according to the variable name.
   2. Update the alt text for your photo in the same manner but with the `photoPathAltText` constant.
3. Run the site locally to make sure the links are correct and nothing breaks before merging.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT CHANGE

- `_app.tsx`, `_document.ts`, `index.tsx` has to stay within the `/pages` folder or else Next.js won't build correctly.
- `/public` folder has live site things, DO NOT CHANGE
- `/src/types/*.*` don't touch anything in this folder.

## üìÅ General Structure

### Images

Every media that needs to be on the site (exclude cursors and typefaces) go in the `public` folder.

The structure is:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <intuitive name for folder of things>
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Code

The actual code file is pretty simple:

- `/src/pages` is the folder with the necessary pages for the site to run, try not to modify it too much unless you need to change some tags.
- `/src/styles` is the folder for anything to do with styling
  - it consists of the `/cursor` and `/fonts` folder with the respective files
  - `global.css` is where hard-coded styles and definitive styles live.
  - Most styling is done in the `tailwind.config.ts` file that lives outside the /src/ folder.
- `/src/api` is a folder with a default `hello.ts` api file. Modify this if necessary for apis.

**Where you'll be coding the most**

- `/src/components` consists of all the components and utility files are.
  - `/src/components/util` is a folder for util functions, constants, etc. Feel free to create new util files if you can't add any to the pre-existing ones
- `/src/landing` has all the different sections of the landing page. It is where changes can occur.
  - In a multipage site, this is where all the "pages" would go, but here it is just sections.

## üåë Dark Mode Light Mode

This site has dark/light mode configured automatically already.

Colours for dark mode are defined in global.css and the tailwind colours reference them.

> Do not hard code hex/rgba/cmyk inline as this will not configure things properly.
