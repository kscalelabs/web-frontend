# Introducing K-Scale Labs

In 1964, Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev proposed a scale for measuring a civilization’s level of technological advancement based on energy consumption. A Type 1 civilization on this scale is one which can harness all the energy available on its planet. A Type 2 civilization is one which can harness all of the energy from a star. A Type 3 civilization is one which can harness all the energy from a galaxy.

Our mission at K-Scale Labs is to move humanity to a Type 1 Kardashev civilization within my lifetime. Why is this a good idea? Barring more abstract philosophical conceptualizations of “the good life”, harnessing more energy is what makes peoples’ lives better. Famine, poverty, natural disasters, cost of living — most of the problems that people care about, at their core, stem from a collective inability to harness energy for useful outcomes in one way or another. A world where it is practically free to have something done — in other words, a world with less scarcity and more abundance — is one in which most of humanity’s problems become political rather than technical.

### Time-to-T1 for different growth rates in energy consumption.

As an engineering problem, reaching a Type 1 civilization in my lifetime until very recently felt like an impossible task. However, in the context of general-purpose intelligence, it seems much more tractable. In a world with a general-purpose agent for every human, increasing humanity’s energy consumption by 15% annually simply means something like 30% of those agents copying themselves once per year.

Our goal at K-Scale Labs is to make this world possible, by designing a platform for general-purpose embodied intelligence and making it freely available for anyone to build. We believe that working towards this future should be the collective project of all of humanity, rather than the work of a few companies in Silicon Valley — in the same way that beavers build dams and birds build nests, humans build abundance. If you would like to build this future with us, we would be happy to have you.
